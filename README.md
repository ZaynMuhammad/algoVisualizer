# AlgoVisualizer

## Goal:
I used to watch these visualizers back in uni when I was learning data structures and algorithms and I remember being in awe of how something like this can be built.

I decided to try my hand and building my own! I'm pretty happy with where it's at, but I'd like to revist this and add more algo's and perhaps visualize some

data sturctures as well.

Here is a link to see a live demo of the project:
